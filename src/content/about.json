  "context": "Hello! I'm Andrew Churchill. I was born and raised in Somerville, MA. Currently I study computer science and math at MIT, and outside of that my favorite ways to spend my time include Ultimate Frisbee, cooking and/or baking, playing Rocket League, and spending time with my lovely girlfriend (not necessarily in that order). I'm passionate about combatting injustice, learning and teaching, and technology (in that order). Scroll down to see more about me and my life!"
